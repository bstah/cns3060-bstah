Project 6

In part a of the assignment it did exactly what I expected it to do. I thought that the program would run straight through and fail to incrament the counter which it did and the counter was left at 0.
In part b I did expect there to be a random result since the threads were running through the same thing at the time. Since they were running the same thing at the same time it made it so that the last thread running made the number what it was which turned out to be 10.
I didn't expect the results that I got on part c. It actually got the count right for some reason. I expected a random number like what I experienced in part b.
Part d of course I expected the right outcome since only one thread could enter the code at a time making the program run the right way.

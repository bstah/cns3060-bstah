I found that the shortest seek time first tended to take less traverses than the other algorithms.
I also could see that sometimes the scan-look could have less traverses than the shortest seek time in some situation that I happened across.
The first come first serve algorithm was the easiest to write, but tended to take more traverses than the other two algorithms.
The shortest seek time first was the algorithm that took me the most time to write.
